  bio: `Hi! I'm a sophomore at Olin College of Engineering near Boston. Iâ€™ve been building software for 6 years.
I love building cool stuff and challenging myself, whether that be making a self-balancing cube or completing an Ironman.
In my free time I enjoy watching and playing basketball and F1, riding horses, and gokarting.`,
