  bio: `Hi! I’m a sophomore at Olin College of Engineering near Boston with six years of experience 
    building software. I love taking on ambitious projects, whether that means creating a self-balancing 
    cube or completing an Ironman. I’m always looking for the next challenge, both technically and physically. 
    Outside of engineering, I enjoy playing basketball, watching F1, riding horses, and go-karting.`,
